### Description

A ColorPicker that is similar to Adobe photoshop & Corel Color Picker.

This was actually developed for my Paint Programme.

It is faster and have mainly 3 modes of Color spaces and Preset mode containing safe palette and custom colors.

The color algorithms have been optimized for speed.

The same code have been translated into C++ and posted in PSC. see 'Great ColorPicker'. See this also and notice the speed difference between C++ and VB that use same algorithm.

All Suggestions and VOTES are welcome.
